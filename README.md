# Pedagogical Aid: Comparison and Analysis of Convex Hull Solutions.

This repo houses my CSCI 716 final Project, a learning tool for Convex Hull Solutions. 
My project allows the user to compare the brute force, Graham's Scan, Divide and Conquer,
and Jarvis's March solutions to the Convex Hull problem. The user is able 
to step through each solution, seeing the progress of the algorithm at each
step. The pedagogical aid also allows the user to run each solution on 
a wide number of points in order to compare the run time of each solution.
This provides value in allowing the user to further their understanding of
each algorithm and the Convex Hull problem as a whole. Additionally, the 
two modes of comparison (step through and run time) allow the user to
understand more fully the improvements that each solution provides over
the brute force solution.
