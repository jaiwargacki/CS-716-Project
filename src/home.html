<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p style="width: 80%; padding-left: 10%;">
<!--- A specific description of the problem that you are trying to solve, in two sentences or less. 
    This may be an answer to a question like: What does your application do? 
    What is your visualization trying to show? What open problem were you trying to address?-->

Expanding on the solutions implemented for assignment 1, my project 
allows the user to compare the brute force, Graham's Scan, Divide and Conquer,
and Jarvis's March solutions to the Convex Hull problem. The user is able 
to step through each solution, seeing the progress of the algorithm at each
step. The pedagogical aid also allows the user to run each solution on 
a wide number of points in order to compare the run time of each solution.
This provides value in allowing the user to further their understanding of
each algorithm and the Convex Hull problem as a whole. Additionally, the 
two modes of comparison (step through and run time) allow the user to
understand more fully the improvements that each solution provides over
the brute force solution.

<!--- Background information about the problem and approach. Does not need to be 
    long (one or two paragraphs is ok), but state any assumptions that are necessary 
    for your approach to work-->

The Convex Hull problem is a classic problem in computational geometry. It is defined 
given a set P of points in the plane, the convex hull of P, denoted conv(P), 
can be defined intuitively by surrounding a collection of points with a rubber 
band and then letting the rubber band 'snap' tightly around the points.
The convex hull problem has a wide range of applications in many fields. For example in mathematics, 
convex hulls are used to study polynomials and matrix eigenvalues. 
In economics, convex hulls can be used to apply methods of convexity in economics to non-convex markets.
Other relevant fields include statistics, combinatorial optimization, and geometric modeling.

<br><br><br>

The 4 algorithms implemented in this project are the brute force, Graham's Scan,
Divide and Conquer, and Jarvis's March solutions. The brute force solution is the
simplest solution to the convex hull problem. It works by looping through a 3 
nested for loop, checking every possible line segment to confirm which 
points are on the convex hull. The brute force solution has a run time of O(n^3).
Graham's Scan algorithm finds the top and bottom hull for a set of sorted points.
It is very efficient for sets of points that are already sorted. The run time of
Graham's Scan is O(nlogn). Divide and 
Conquer is a recursive algorithm that splits the set of points into two sets, 
finding the convex hull of each set, and then merging the two convex hulls by finding 
the upper and lower tangents for each merged hull. The run time of Divide and Conquer
is O(nlogn). Jarvis's March is an iterative algorithm that finds the convex hull by
tracking the next point on the convex hull. The run time of Jarvis's March is O(nh)
where h is the number of points on the convex hull. It's worst case run time is O(n^2)
and therefore is not as efficient as Graham's Scan or Divide and Conquer.

<!-- Describe the pseudo-code of the algorithm that you are creating and highlight
     what parts of that pseudocode you are animating.-->

For the code walk through portion of the application below, no pseudo-code is
provided. Instead the code is written in JavaScript and is displayed in the
code walkthrough section of the application. The application provides a 
debugger-like experience, allowing the user to step through the code line by
line. At each step, the user is provided with a description of the current
step, a highlighted line of code, and information about relevant variables.
The only "pseudo-code" like element of the application is the fact that the 
user is unable to step into any of the helper functions. This is done to 
keep the focus on the logic of the convex hull algorithms rather than 
creating an in-browser debugger. The results of both tabs always display the 
final convex hull in the left window.

<!-- Discuss any interesting choices that you made in the implementation of the algorithm. -->

Very few design choices were made during the completion of this project. The only one that 
comes to mind is in order to keep consistency between the different algorithms, 
all algorithms made sure to remove the center points of collinear points from the
convex hull. This was done to keep the convex hulls of each algorithm consistent.
Another design choice of note specific to this application is the order of points in the 
convex hull. In order to draw the convex hull, the points must be in order. This is 
done by sorting the points by their angle from the center point in a counter-clockwise order.
The final choice I made was to not include a live line graph of the run time of each algorithm.
I had previously planned on including this in the application, however, as I implemented it 
I found it to not be very useful without a much more advanced graphing library. 
The basic line graphs I was able to create were not very useful in comparing the run time of
each algorithm specifically because of the automatic scaling my manual graphing did. 
If I were to expand the functionality of this application, I would be interested
in bringing in a more interactive graphing library to allow the user to zoom in on
specific portions of the graph making that feature more useful.
