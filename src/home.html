<h3>Project Overview</h3>

Expanding on the solutions implemented for assignment 1, my project will 
allow the user to compare the brute force, Graham's Scan, Divide and Conquer,
and Jarvis's March solutions to the Convex Hull problem. The user will be able 
to step through each solution, seeing the progress of the algorithm at each
step. The pedagogical aid will also allow the user to run each solution on 
a wide number of points in order to compare the run time of each solution.
This provides value in allowing the user to further their understanding of
each algorithm and the Convex Hull problem as a whole. Additionally, the 
two modes of comparison (step through and run time) allow the user to
understand more fully the improvements that each solution provides over
the brute force solution.
